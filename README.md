# BellyButton_Biodiversity

Project Overview
In this module, we will use Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web. The completed work will be displayed in a portfolio we created as a live demo web.

Resources
Data Source: index.html, samples.json, plots_challenge_dashboard.js
Software: VS Code, Web browser, Command-line interface, GitHub

Objectives
By the end of this module, we will be able to:

- Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
- Use D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
- Parse data in JSON format.
- Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
- Use JavaScript’s Math library to manipulate numbers.
- Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.
- How to use interactivity to enhance your visualizations.
- Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.

Summary
Challenge Overview
In this challenge, we have a partially completed dashboard, but need to finish it. We have a completed panel for demographic information and now need to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, our volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel.

Challenge Objectives
The goals of this challenge are for us to:

Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
Complete the demographic information panel, if you have not done so.
